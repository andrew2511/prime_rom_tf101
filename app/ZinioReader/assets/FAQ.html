				<div class="sub_accordian">
					<h2 class="contracted">What does the download icon next to an issue mean?</h2>
					<div style="display: none;" class="sub_content">
						<p>To read a magazine, you must first download the files to your Android device. The download icon is shown next to issues that haven't yet been downloaded. When you select one, you can preview the magazine as the pages load.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sub_accordian">
					<h2 class="contracted">Why is a Wi-Fi connection recommended to download an issue?</h2>
					<div style="display: none;" class="sub_content">
						<p>Magazine files can be quite large, which means they could take a very long time to download over a cellular network. To make sure you download the files quickly and without errors, you should be connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sub_accordian">
					<h2 class="contracted">I want to read my magazines on a plane, subway or ferry.</h2>
					<div style="display: none;" class="sub_content">
						<p>To read a magazine, you must first download the files to your Android device. Make sure to download your magazines while connected to a Wi-Fi network for best performance. Once an issue is downloaded, you can read it anywhere - no network connection necessary. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sub_accordian">
					<h2 class="contracted">Why is my Android library different than my Zinio web library?</h2>
					<div style="display: none;" class="sub_content">
						<p>If you have an existing Zinio library you may notice that not all of your publications show up in the Zinio Android application. This is because we are still in the process of translating the thousands of titles in our library to the Android. While we have many titles on the Android device, mostly are the latest issues that are currently available. Zinio is working diligently to make all titles and past issues viewable as well.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sub_accordian">
					<h2 class="contracted">How do I delete a magazine issue?</h2>
					<div style="display: none;" class="sub_content">
						<p>You can delete magazine files from your Android device to free up memory. You will still be entitled to the issue, and it will be marked as available for download in your library. From the Library list screen, tap the Android device MENU button.  Then select "delete" from the menu. Select the magazines you'd like deleted, then tap the "delete" button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
